# ES6 Promises: Mastering Asynchronous JavaScript

This project is designed to help you understand and master the power of Promises in JavaScript. By the end, you'll be able to confidently write asynchronous code that is both efficient and readable.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- **Promises (how, why, and what):** Understand the fundamental concept of Promises, why they are essential for asynchronous operations, and how they work under the hood.
- then, resolve, catch methods: Master the core methods of the Promise object:
then: Chain together actions to be performed when a Promise resolves successfully.
resolve: Explicitly resolve a Promise with a value.
catch: Handle errors that occur during Promise execution.
- All methods of the Promise object: Explore and understand the full range of methods available for working with Promises, including all, race, finally, and more.
- throw/try: Learn how to handle errors gracefully using try...catch blocks within Promise chains.
- The await operator: Discover the power of the await operator, which simplifies asynchronous code by allowing you to pause execution until a Promise resolves.
- Async functions: Master the use of async functions, which provide a cleaner and more readable way to work with Promises and the await operator.
